# Open Questions

Unresolved questions that need thought but aren't blocking active work.
When a question is resolved, move it to the **Resolved** section with a
one-line answer and link to the decision or commit that settled it.

Questions that become blocking should move to `next-up.md` (Blocked section).
Questions that lead to structural tradeoffs should become decisions in
`plans/decisions/`.

## Active

### Should the coverage gate be higher than 94%?

The 94% threshold was chosen early (relaxed from 90%) and has worked well.
As the library count grows and test patterns mature, revisit whether 95% or
higher is appropriate — or whether the gate should vary by library maturity
(stricter for stable, relaxed for experimental).

### Is ESP32 NVS worth a dedicated backend?

The settings library design (next-up.md) defers an NVS backend because NVS
has per-key semantics rather than blob storage.  Worth investigating whether
a thin NVS adapter could present the same `read`/`write` protocol, or whether
NVS is different enough to warrant a separate storage abstraction entirely.

### How much test boilerplate can be reduced?

`next-up.md` mentions "explore test ergonomics."  Common patterns across test
files (importing fakes, constructing services with FakeTicks, asserting on
check/handle cycles) might benefit from shared fixtures or a small test DSL.
Risk: test-only abstractions that obscure what's being tested.

### Should examples be runnable on CPython by default?

Currently, simulated examples must run on CPython without hardware.  Hardware
examples are prefixed `circuitpython_*` / `micropython_*`.  As more libraries
interact with hardware, the ratio will shift.  Should the default assumption
change, or should simulation remain the norm with hardware examples as
opt-in?

### What does "contributor-ready" look like beyond docs?

CONTRIBUTING.md, issue templates, and PR templates exist.  But contributor
experience also includes: good-first-issue labeling, response time
expectations, mentoring patterns for agent-assisted contributors, and
community channels.  What's the minimum viable contributor experience
before actively seeking contributions?
